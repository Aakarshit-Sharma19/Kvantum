V0.6.3
---------
 * Use "sudo make install" for installation.
 * Added a new variable for spreading the indicator of a progressbar across its whole groove and not just its interior.
 * Removed ugly (flat) backgrounds from toolboxes.

V0.6.2
---------
 * Don't display a combo toggled when its menu isn't shown.
 * Don't use the focus text color for toggled or pressed widgets.
 * Added a toggle text color (distinct from press text color).
 * Level a popup list with the bottom or top edge of its combobox while not letting the former cover the latter.
 * Don't use toggled and pressed states for the progressbar indicator.

V0.6.1
---------
 * Organized frame and interior rendering (some frame parts were rendered twice).
 * Ignore the pressed state for tabs.
 * Don't use toolbar's frame and interior size specifications for its handle or separator.
 * With styled window backgrounds, remove ugly flat backgrounds from scroll areas even when they have frame.
 * Added a 2px right margin to menu-items when they have arrow or check/radio button.
 * Fixed transparent MDI subwindows.

V0.6
---------
 * Whole windows and dialogs can be styled with an interior element now. The section [Window] is added for that.
 * Removed the redundant section [Widget].
 * Removed ugly flat backgrounds as far as possible when the window backround is styled.

V0.5.3
---------
 * Derive all slider handles from the main one when its length and width are different.
 * Use interiorRect() instead of labelRect() for drawing menuitem indicators.
 * Added a little extra space to menuitems when they have indicators.
 * Don't focus a tool button if only its arrow is focused.
 * When tabs are joined together, don't join the selected tab to its adjacent one(s).
 * Clearing the attribute WA_OpaquePaintEvent from scrollbars is a better solution for their transparency problem than filling their rectangles with the window background.
 * Fixes.

V0.5.2
---------
 * No out-of-grid text, icon, checkbox or tool-button.
 * Give space to slider ticks.
 * Draw slider tickmarks when available.
 * Less concave pressed/toggled buttons look more natural.

V0.5.1
---------
 * Added optional top and bottom (or left and right) glows for scrollbar sliders.
 * Fixed the position of shortcut text for a menu-item that points to a submenu (like in the Extract menu-item of Ark's Action menu).
 * Fixed a condition for rendering (button) texts of Plasma related apps.

V0.5
---------
 * Added optional inactive sub-states. The default theme doesn't use them.
 * Respect the toolbar text color with auto-raised buttons.
 * Read kdeglobals for deciding how to activate view items with single-click as the fallback.
 * Exclude "appmenu" as a Plasma app.
 * Use the old-fashioned method to get the application name because, apparently, applicationName() doesn't work with all Qt4 versions.

V0.4.1
---------
 * Corrected slider position and groove.
 * No redundant arrow on toolbuttons.
 * Force the tooltip (normal) text color.
 * Set the group-box title color.
 * Draw a more elegant rubber band.
 * Added the possibility to set the slider thickness and also the length and thickness of slider handles.
 * Skip ugly frames.
 * No frame for a line-edit inside a view-item whose text is being edited.

V0.4
---------
 * Added the possibility to set the normal, focused and pressed text colors for non-editable widgets. If no (valid) color is set, the color scheme will be used.
 * Added the possibility to set the size of radio buttons and checkboxes without making those on menuitems bigger than usual.
 * Fixed a miscalculation in getting the horizontal scrollbar groove from the vertical one.
 * Set the widths of opposite frames of tool buttons equal to each other when there's only text in them.
 * Fixed instant and delayed popup arrows of tool buttons.
 * Considered the top and bottom frames of line-edits inside editable combos.
 * Corrected the interior of line-edits inside spinboxes.
 * Corrected the width of menu items when they have no icons.
 * Ignore the text margins in getting the rectangle of a (button) label when it's just an icon.
 * Put the contents of tab widgets inside their frames.
 * Fixed labels of vertical progressbars with thick frames.

V0.3.1
---------
 * Adjust the splitter indicator to fit in the handle when the latter is too thin.
 * Get the text shadow color as a string.
 * Minor fixes.

V0.3
---------
 * Added the possibility to raise and group neighbor toolbar (tool) buttons.
 * Translucent tooltips with shadow and rounded corners when compositing is available and enabled.

V0.2.2
---------
 * Don't enable compositing for torn-off menus.
 * Excluded "Qt-subapplication" from compositing. So far, only VirtualBox has introduced itself in that way.
 * If a key is not found in a group from the user config file, first search the "inherits" group(s) of the same file and only then go to the default config.
 * Fixed tiny QStackedWidget arrows (in Qt4 Designer).

V0.2.1
---------
 * Added the possibility to have translucent menus or tooltips with compositing. Now they can also have rounded corners.
 * Added optional menu shadows without inheritance from the default theme (the general plan is to not inherit anything related to compositing from the default theme).
 * A mild shadow and a little translucency for menus of the default theme.
 * Don't use PE_FrameMenu because it would result in frameless menus sometimes.
 * Corrected the position of the menu tear-off indicator.
 * Fixes for preventing any crash.

V0.2
---------
 * Added an alternative glassy theme as a demo.
 * Added documentation for the first release.

V0.1.4
---------
 * Added the capability to drag windows from everywhere by consulting the sources of Oxygen, QtCurve and Bespin.
 * Added workarounds for LibreOffice.
 * Vertical dock titles are taken into account.
 * Text eliding for titles of docks and QMdiSubWindows.
 * Fixed falling back to the default configuration.
 * Removed extra objects from the SVG image.
 * Miscellaneous fixes. Now Kvantum is robust and almost ready to be publicly available :)

V0.1.3
---------
 * Took care of orientation for all widgets by using appropriate transformations.
 * To know the orientation of splitters, check their height and width instead of State_Horizontal.
 * Added the possibility to attach the active tab to the tab widget.
 * Added decorative indicators to splitters.
 * Added grip indicators to scrollbar sliders.
 * Removed animation as it wasn't practical.
 * Removed the config interface since it didn't make configuration easier.

V0.1.2
---------
 * sizeCalculated() can give wrong results in many cases, so use it only when needed.
 * To force frames on view-items, adjust PM_FocusFrameHMargin and PM_FocusFrameVMargin (-> Qt4 -> qcommonstyle.cpp).
 * Set SH_Menu_SloppySubMenus to true for being able to reach submenus by moving the cursor diagonally (bug #315346 at KDE Bugtracking System).
 * Don't remove tab bottom frames; users could remove them if they want to.
 * Fixed the transparency problem of scrollbars.
 * Fixed tabbar scroll buttons by adjusting PM_TabBar_ScrollButtonOverlap and PM_TabBarScrollButtonWidth.
 * Don't press a tool buttton if only its arrow is pressed.
 * A separate pressed or focused (hover) state for each spin button.
 * Treat arrows as icons for tool buttons.
 * Don't draw the interior of a Plasma spinbox.
 * Workaround for some Plasma tool buttons that pretend to have only icons. (why does Plasma sometimes take its style from the window style in the first place?)
 * Workaround for some apps (like Kdenlive with its TimecodeDisplay) that presuppose all spinboxes should have vertical buttons.
 * Fixed (Krita's) progress-spin boxes by checking the orientation of QProgressBars instead of checking State_Horizontal.
 * Fixed some hidden bugs by consulting Qt's qcommonstyle.cpp.

V0.1.1
---------
 * Added shortcut handler (mnemonics with Alt pressed) by consulting QtCurve's source.
 * Fixed the problem of long texts with combo boxes.
 * Took into account the height of checkbox/radio-button indicators for having a reasonable vertical distance between them.
 * Fixed Akregator's tabs.
 * Handled view-item texts inside buttons, like in Kate's font preferences.
 * Took care of vertical buttons in some apps (like digiKam) by not using sizeCalculated().
 * Other fixes.

V0.1
---------
 * Kvantum is born as a fork of QuantumStyle. Many bugs are fixed and some missing widgets are added so that it is fairly usable now but there is still a lot of work to do.
