A PDF version of this document is also included for easier reading.

The configuration of the default Kvantum theme can be changed by following these steps:

(1) Create the folder "~/.config/Kvantum/" (~ is your home);

(2) Create the file "kvantum.kvconfig" in the above folder with this line in it:

theme=MY_THEME

Here, MY_THEME could be any name you choose for the new configuration;

(3) Create the folder "~/.config/Kvantum/MY_THEME/" and the file "MY_THEME.kvconfig" inside it;

(4) In the file "MY_THEME.kvconfig", you could write down your own configuration. The easiest way is to copy/paste the contents of "style/themeconfig/default.kvconfig" (from the source) to it and change the values of some variables. Please note that deleting a variable often means that its value will be taken from the default configuration, so that you could keep only those sections or variables you want to change. See below for a more accurate explanation.

There are many sections and variables in the config file. That's intentional: unlike most theme engines, Kvantum is supposed to be able to control virtually all aspects of widgets.

Here are the meanings of various sections:

=====================================================


The following table shows the variables (keys) you could change to configure the current theme -- without necessarily making a new one. These are the rules for the value inheritance:

(1) If a section (group) is not present in your configuration, its variables and their values will be taken from the default config file.

(2) If a variable is not present in a section of your configuration:
      (2a) First the "inherits" section will be searched for it and then, If nothing is found,
      (2b) its value will be taken from the same section of the default config file.

There are three logical exceptions to these rules:

Exception No.1: The "inherits" variable will not be taken from the default config file if it is not present.

Exception No.2: If normal,focused or pressed text colors are omitted or not valid or if a section they could belong to is not present, they will be taken from the currently used color scheme.

Exception No.3: Any variable related to compositing will be neglected if omitted. For now, there are only three compositing variables, namely, "composite", "menu_shadow_depth" and "tooltip_shadow_depth".

If you want to make your own theme (see the file "Theme-Making"), you'll also need to know the meanings of these variables:


=====================================================
Variable                Value                Meaning
=====================================================
interior.element       string                The SVG element to be used
                                             for drawing the interior of
                                             a widget.

frame.element          string                The SVG element to be used
                                             for drawing the frame of a
                                             widget.


indicator.element      string                The SVG element to be used

                                             a widget.

Some Examples
=============

If you don’t want menus and tooltips to be translucent or cast shadow and want the color scheme to be used for all texts, you could use a blank configuration or a very basic one with just this in it:

[%General]

You could also be more explicit:

[%General]
composite=false

[PanelButtonCommand]
text.normal.color=none
text.focus.color=none
text.press.color=none

Here "none" is not a valid color, so text colors will be taken from the currently used color scheme.

If you want to have bigger buttons without increasing your font sizes, you could use this:

[%General]
composite=true
menu_shadow_depth=6
tooltip_shadow_depth=6

[PanelButtonCommand]
text.normal.color=white
text.focus.color=#80C0FF
text.press.color=#white
text.margin.top=4
text.margin.bottom=4
text.margin.left=5
text.margin.right=5

[PanelButtonTool]
inherits=PanelButtonCommand

To have black text shadows with light green focused text, use this (black text shadows are already defined but disabled in the default config file):

[%General]
composite=true
menu_shadow_depth=6
tooltip_shadow_depth=6

[PanelButtonCommand]
text.normal.color=white
text.focus.color=lightgreen
text.press.color=white
text.shadow=true

Note that, in the two examples above, the compositing values and normal/focused text colors are also added because otherwise, they would be disabled (see the exceptions above). In the previous example, customized text colors were disabled for all widgets other than push-buttons because there were no sections for them. If you want them back, you could add sections like these:

[PanelButtonTool]
inherits=PanelButtonCommand

[Tab]
inherits=PanelButtonCommand

[MenuItem]
inherits=PanelButtonCommand

And so on.
