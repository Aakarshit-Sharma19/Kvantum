A PDF version of this document is also included for easier reading.

The configuration of the default Kvantum theme can be easily copied by using Kvantum Manager (click Save button on its third page) or, manually, by following these steps:

(1) Create the folder "~/.config/Kvantum/" (~ is your home);

(2) Create the file "kvantum.kvconfig" in the above folder with this line in it:

theme=DefaultCopy

Here, DefaultCopy could be any name you choose for the new configuration;

(3) Create the folder "~/.config/Kvantum/DefaultCopy/" and the file "DefaultCopy.kvconfig" inside it;

(4) Copy/paste the contents of "style/themeconfig/default.kvconfig" (from the source) to "DefaultCopy.kvconfig".

Now, you can change the values of variables (keys). Please note that deleting a variable often means that its value will be taken from the default configuration, so that you could keep only those sections or variables you want to change. See below for a more accurate explanation.

There are many sections and variables in the config file. That's intentional: unlike most theme engines, Kvantum is supposed to be able to control virtually all aspects of widgets. Here are the meanings of various sections:

The following table shows the variables (keys) you could change to configure the current theme -- without necessarily making a new one. These are the rules for the value inheritance:

(1) If a section (group) is not present in your configuration, its variables and their values will be taken from the default config file.

(2) If a variable is not present in a section of your configuration:
      (2a) First the "inherits" section will be searched for it and then, if nothing is found,
      (2b) its value will be taken from the same section of the default config file.

There are three exceptions to these rules:

Exception No.1: The "inherits" variable will not be taken from the default config file if it is not present in a section.

Exception No.2: If colors are omitted or not valid or if a section they could belong to is not present, they will be taken from the currently used color scheme. Also font boldness/italicity will be ignored if omitted.

Exception No.3: Any variable related to compositing or hacking will be ignored if omitted.

Some Examples
=============

If you don’t want menus and tooltips to be translucent or cast shadow and want the color scheme to be used for all texts, you could use a blank configuration or a very basic one with just this in it:

[%General]

You could also be more explicit:

[%General]
composite=false

[PanelButtonCommand]
text.normal.color=none
text.focus.color=none
text.press.color=none
text.toggle.color=none

Here "none" is not a valid color, so text colors will be taken from the currently used color scheme.

If you want to have bigger buttons without increasing your font sizes, you could use this:

[%General]
composite=true
menu_shadow_depth=6
tooltip_shadow_depth=6

[PanelButtonCommand]
text.normal.color=white
text.focus.color=#80C0FF
text.press.color=#white
text.toggle.color=#white
text.margin.top=4
text.margin.bottom=4
text.margin.left=5
text.margin.right=5

[PanelButtonTool]
inherits=PanelButtonCommand

To have black text shadows with light green focused text, use this (black text shadows are already defined but disabled in the default config file):

[%General]
composite=true
menu_shadow_depth=6
tooltip_shadow_depth=6

[PanelButtonCommand]
text.normal.color=white
text.focus.color=lightgreen
text.press.color=white
text.toggle.color=white
text.shadow=true

Note that, in the two examples above, the compositing values and normal/focused text colors are also added because otherwise, they would be disabled (see the exceptions above). In the previous example, customized text colors were disabled for all widgets other than push-buttons because there were no sections for them. If you want them back, you could add sections like these:

[PanelButtonTool]
inherits=PanelButtonCommand

[Tab]
inherits=PanelButtonCommand

[MenuItem]
inherits=PanelButtonCommand

And so on.
