ABOUT:

Kvantum (by Pedram Pourang, aka. Tsu Jan <tsujan2000@gmail.com>) is an SVG-based theme engine for Qt4 and KDE4. Its Homepage is:

	https://github.com/tsujan/Kvantum

Kvantum started as a fork of QuantumStyle, which is not developed anymore but whose author continued his work under another name (https://github.com/DexterMagnific/QSvgStyle). However, apart from the basic logic behind them, they are very different creatures now. My emphasis has been on usability, practicality and elegance.

Kvantum has a default dark theme, which should be used alongside the KDE/Qt4 color scheme included in the source and is inspired by the default theme of Enlightenment. Creation of such a theme for KDE was my first reason to make Kvantum but it goes far beyond its default theme: you could make themes with very different looks and feels for it and Kvantum will let you control almost every aspect of Qt widgets.

Please see INSTALL for instructions on compilation, installation and usage!

For instructions on how to change configuration or make new themes, read the files Theme-Config and Theme-Making in the "doc" folder!
