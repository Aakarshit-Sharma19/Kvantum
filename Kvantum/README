ABOUT:

Kvantum (by Pedram Pourang, aka. Tsu Jan <tsujan2000@gmail.com>) is an SVG-based theme engine for Qt4/Qt5 and KDE. Its Homepage is:

	https://github.com/tsujan/Kvantum

Kvantum started as a fork of QuantumStyle, which is not developed anymore but whose author continued his work under another name (https://github.com/DexterMagnific/QSvgStyle). However, apart from the basic logic behind them, they are very different creatures. My emphasis has been on elegance, usability and practicality.

Kvantum has a default dark theme, which is inspired by the default theme of Enlightenment. Creation of realistic themes like that for KDE was my first reason to make Kvantum but it goes far beyond its default theme: you could make themes with very different looks and feels for it, whether they be photorealistic or cartoonish, 3D or flat, embellished or minimalistic, or something in between, and Kvantum will let you control almost every aspect of Qt widgets.

Please see INSTALL for instructions on compilation, installation and usage!

For instructions on how to change configuration or make new themes, read the files Theme-Config and Theme-Making in the "doc" folder!
