*******************
*   Compilation   *
*******************

First install X11 and Qt development packages. In Debian-based systems, they are:

* libx11-dev and libxext-dev (for X11)
* libqt4-dev (for Qt4)
* qtbase5-dev, libqt5svg5-dev and libqt5x11extras5-dev (for Qt5 and only if you want Qt5 support)

Then open a terminal inside this folder and issue the following command:

	qmake && make

You might need to put the full path of qmake in the above command, especially for a second compilation against Qt5. For example, in 64-bit Debian, it is /usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/qt4/bin/qmake for Qt4 and /usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/qt5/bin/qmake for Qt5.

********************
*   Installation   *
********************

Then, use these commands for installation and cleaning:

	sudo make install
	make distclean

The second command cleans the source and makes it ready for another compilation (against Qt5, for example).

Installation for Qt4 is necessary but you could compile and install Kvantum twice, first for Qt4 and then for Qt5. If you use KDE and have chosen Kvantum in System Settings, all Qt4 and Qt5 apps will have the same Kvantum look.

Kvantum Manager uses the Qt5 plugin but you could manually compile it against Qt4 by opening a terminal inside the folder "kvantummanager" and issue the compilation command using the Qt4 qmake.

*************
*   Usage   *
*************

In KDE:
=======
(1) Select Kvantum from 'System Settings > Application Appearance > Colors > Scheme' and click Apply.

(2) Select Kvantum from 'System Settings > Application Appearance > Style > Applications > Widget style' and apply it. Logging out and in would be good for Plasma to see the new theme.


In Other DEs and for Qt4:
=========================
Select Kvantum from 'qtconfig-qt4 > Appearance > Select GUI Style' and then, save the result with 'File > Save'.

In Other DEs and for Qt5:
=========================
Unfortunately, there is no qtconfig for Qt5. You could use this command to run a Qt5 application APP:

	APP -style kvantum

Or add this to your '~/profile' or '~/.bashrc':

	export QT_STYLE_OVERRIDE=kvantum

**************************
*   Using Other Themes   *
**************************

To install and select Kvantum themes other than the default one, use "Kvantum Manager", which is already installed and is available in the start menu as a utility app. It explains each step in a straightforward way. With it, you could switch between themes easily.

If the KDE color scheme of the theme is inside its folder, "Kvantum Manager" will install it too. So, theme makers may want to put these files in their theme folder: THEME_NAME.svg, THEME_NAME.kvconfig and THEME_NAME.colors.

Themes can also be packaged as deb, rpm,... packages and installed as root. The root installation path should be /usr/share/Kvantum (if PREFIX=/usr) and the KDE color schemes should go to /usr/share/kde4/apps/color-schemes. If a theme is installed both as root and as user, the latter installation will take priority.

***********
*   GTK   *
***********

Kvantum does not (and will not) have any relation to GTK but if you want your GTK apps to have a look that matches the default Kvantum theme, you could download E17gtk from:

http://gnome-look.org/content/show.php/E17gtk?content=163472

Put its extracted folder in '/usr/share/themes/' and select it from 'System Settings > Application Appearance > GTK > GTK Themes' for both GTK2 and GTK3.
