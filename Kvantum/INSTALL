*******************
*   Compilation   *
*******************

First install X11 and Qt development packages. In Debian-based systems, they are:

* libx11-dev and libxext-dev (for X11)
* libqt4-dev (for Qt4 and if you want Qt4 support)
* qtbase5-dev, libqt5svg5-dev and libqt5x11extras5-dev (for Qt5)

Then open a terminal inside this folder and issue the following command:

	qmake && make

You might need to put the full path of qmake in the above command (especially for a second compilation against your non-default Qt installation). For example, in 64-bit Debian, it is /usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/qt4/bin/qmake for Qt4 and /usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/qt5/bin/qmake for Qt5.

********************
*   Installation   *
********************

Then, use these commands for installation and cleaning:

	sudo make install
	make distclean

The second command cleans the source and makes it ready for another compilation (against another version of Qt, for example).

Installation for your default Qt version (Qt5, in most distros) is necessary but you could compile and install Kvantum twice, once for Qt5 and then for Qt4.

Kvantum Manager uses the Qt5 plugin but you could manually compile it against Qt4 by opening a terminal inside the folder "kvantummanager" and issuing the compilation command using the Qt4 qmake.

*************
*   Usage   *
*************

In KDE:
=======
(1) Select Kvantum from 'System Settings > (Application Appearance >) Color(s > Scheme)' and click Apply.

(2) Select Kvantum from 'System Settings > Application Appearance/Style > (Style > Applications >) Widget style' and apply it. Logging out and in would be good for Plasma to see the new theme.

In LXQT:
========
(1) Select "kvantum" from Configuration Center > Widget Style. Kvantum Manager is also shown in Configuration Center for changing the Kvantum theme.

(2) Select a corresponding Openbox theme in any way you apply themes for Openbox (some of the installed Openbox themes can be used with different Kvantum themes). Afterward, the easiest way for all LXQT parts to see Kvantum is logging out and in again.

Be sure to disable Compton's shadow for composited Qt menus if the Kvantum theme that you use has its own menu shadow. Because of a Qt5 bug, Compton may not distinguish between Qt5 menus and normal windows, in which case you could add "argb" to the "shadow-exclude" section of '~/.config/compton.conf'

In Other DEs and for Qt4:
=========================
Select Kvantum from 'qtconfig-qt4 > Appearance > Select GUI Style' and then, save the result with 'File > Save'.

In Other DEs and for Qt5:
=========================
Unfortunately, there is no qtconfig for Qt5. In environments that don't have a Qt5 configuration utility, you could use this command to run a Qt5 application APP:

	APP -style kvantum

Or, better, add this to your '~/.profile' or '~/.bashrc':

	export QT_STYLE_OVERRIDE=kvantum

If the display manager you use does not source '~/.profile', you could probably add the above line to '~/.xsessionrc'.

**************************
*   Using Other Themes   *
**************************

To select or install (as user) Kvantum themes, use "Kvantum Manager", which is already installed and is available in the start menu as a utility app. It explains each step in a straightforward way. With it, you could switch between themes easily.

For the running parts of KDE/LXQt to recognize the new Kvantum theme, the easiest way is logging out and in again.

If the KDE color scheme of the theme is inside its folder, "Kvantum Manager" will install it too. So, theme makers may want to put these files in their theme folder: $THEME_NAME.svg, $THEME_NAME.kvconfig and $THEME_NAME.colors.

The contents of theme folders (if valid) can also be installed manually in the user's home. The possible installation paths are '~/.config/Kvantum/$THEME_NAME/', '~/.themes/$THEME_NAME/Kvantum/' and '~/.local/share/themes/$THEME_NAME/Kvantum/', each one of which takes priority over the next one, i.e. if a theme is installed in more than one path, only the instance with the highest priority will be used by Kvantum.

Themes can also be packaged as deb, rpm, xz,... packages and installed as root:
	(1) The possible root installation paths are '/usr/share/Kvantum/$THEME_NAME/' and '/usr/share/themes/$THEME_NAME/Kvantum/' (if PREFIX=/usr). The first path will take priority over the second one if a theme is installed in both.
	(2) The KDE color schemes should go to  '/usr/share/color-schemes/' for KF5 and '/usr/share/kde4/apps/color-schemes/' for KDE4.
	(3) If a theme is installed both as root and as user, the latter installation will take priority.

Please read the last section of "Theme-Making.pdf" for more information on theme installation paths and their priorities.

The default Qt5 installation adds some root themes, that can be selected by using Kvantum Manager.

***********
*   GTK   *
***********

Kvantum does not -- and will not -- have any relation to GTK. However, among its extra themes, it includes KvGnome and KvGnomeDark, which have Gnome-like looks and feels.
