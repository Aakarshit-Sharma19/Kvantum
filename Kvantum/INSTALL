********************
*   Installation   *

Then, use this command for installation:

	sudo make install

*************
*   Usage   *
*************

In KDE:
=======
(1) Select Kvantum from 'System Settings > Application Appearance > Colors > Scheme' and click Apply.

(2) Select Kvantum from 'System Settings > Application Appearance > Style > Applications > Widget style' and apply it. Logging out and in would be good for Plasma to see the new theme.

In Other DEs:
=============
(1) Select Kvantum from 'qtconfig-qt4 > Appearance > Select GUI Style';

(2) Manually enter the colors defined in the file "color/Colors" with 'qtconfig-qt4 > Appearance > Tune Palette...' and then, save the result with 'File > Save'.

**************************
*   Using Other Themes   *
**************************

To install and select Kvantum themes other than the default one, use "Kvantum Manager", which is already installed and is available in the start menu as a utility app. It explains each step in a straightforward way. With it, you could switch between themes easily.

If the KDE color scheme of the theme is inside its folder, "Kvantum Manager" will install it too. So, theme makers may want to put these files in their theme folder: THEME_NAME.svg, THEME_NAME.kvconfig and THEME_NAME.colors.

*   Preview   *

You could click on the binary file "kvantumpreview/kvantumpreview" to see how various widgets look with the currently used theme.
