*************************
*   Preliminary Notes   *
*************************

(1) This file includes instructions on compilation and installation.

(2) Kvantum does not depend on KDE and can be used for theming Qt4 applications under any Linux desktop envirenment (see below).

(3) Kvantum does not provide window decorations. Such jobs are done by the window manager.

*******************
*   Compilation   *
*******************

After installing Qt4 (>= 4.8) and X11 development packages (libqt4-dev and libx11-dev in debian-based systems), just open a terminal inside this folder and issue the following command:

	qmake && make

Optionally, if you have "strip" on your system, also do:

	strip ./style/libkvantum.so

********************
*   Installation   *
********************

KDE:
====
(1) Put libkvantum.so, created in the folder "style", into Qt4's styles directory, which is the following folder in most distros:

	/usr/lib/qt4/plugins/styles/

Create this folder (as root, of course) if it doesn't exist. There may also be other styles directories, like "/usr/lib/kde4/plugins/styles/" or "/usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/qt4/plugins/styles/", but the above one is the best.

(2) Import "color/Kvantum.colors" from 'System Settings > Application Appearance > Colors > Scheme', select it and click Apply.

(3) Choose Kvantum from 'System Settings > Application Appearance > Style > Applications > Widget style' and apply it.

Other DEs:
==========
(1) Like above, put libkvantum.so into "/usr/lib/qt4/plugins/styles/";

(2) Select Kvantum from 'qtconfig-qt4 > Appearance > Select GUI Style';

(3) Manually enter the colors defined in the file "color/Colors" with 'qtconfig-qt4 > Appearance > Tune Palette...' and then, save the result with 'File > Save'.
