Kvantum

ABOUT:

Kvantum (by Pedram Pourang, aka. Tsu Jan <tsujan2000@gmail.com>) is an SVG-based theme engine for Qt4 and KDE4.

Kvantum is a fork of QuantumStyle. The author of QuantumStyle, SaÃ¯d LANKRI, continued his work as QSvgSyle (https://github.com/DexterMagnific/QSvgStyle>) but, apparently, he and I went in different directions; hence the forking. I made lots of fixes, changes and additions, reduced the memory footprint as far as possible, and tried to pay special attention to usability, practicality and elegance.

Kvantum has a default dark theme, which should be used alongside the KDE/Qt4 color scheme included in the source and is inspired by the default theme of Enlightenment. Creation of such a theme for KDE was my main reason to make Kvantum but you could make your own themes for it with Inkscape; Kvantum will let you control almost every aspect of Qt widgets.

Please see INSTALL for instructions on compilation and installation!

For instructions on how to change configuration or make new themes, read the files Theme-Config and Theme-Making in the "doc" folder!
